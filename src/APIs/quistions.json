        "quistion": "How do I wash my Allbirds socks?",
        "answer": "To keep your Allbirds socks looking and feeling their best, we recommend machine washing them in cold water on a gentle cycle. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, as these can damage the fibers. After washing, air dry your socks flat or tumble dry on low heat. This will help maintain their shape and softness."
